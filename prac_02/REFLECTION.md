# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have finished reading the content I have learned in the first two weeks.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I read one or two in my dormitory or library every night.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

As an international student, it is not easy for me to learn new knowledge in a new language. However, during this period, I have persisted in studying and completed my homework on time, even though it was not done very well.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Because I didn't have a foundation in programming before, all the knowledge is new. I think I should spend time on the basics and have a good foundation to facilitate future learning.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Many times, examples are needed to write code.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I am very interested in writing code and think it is a cool thing! so I have been persisting in learning.
